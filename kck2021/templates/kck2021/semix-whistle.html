                                    <li><p>b. This policy is applicable to all SEMIX and SEMIX‚Äôs employees, whether they are full- or part-time, permanent or contract. This policy also encourages anybody doing business with SEMIX Group, including Directors, Shareholders, Consultants, Vendors, Contractors, external agencies, and others, to report or reveal any misconduct that might negatively affect the Company. </p></li>
                                    <li><p>c. To assure that the SEMIX is effectively implementing this policy, it may be periodically reviewed and changed. </p></li>

This Policy also ensures that the Reporting Individual who discloses accusations of such malpractice or misconduct will be held accountable. </p></li>

                                    <li><p>a. The meaning of the word "whistleblowing" refers to a specific method by which a Reporting Individual can report or disclose, through appropriate channels, concerns about actual, potential, or suspected violations of the Code of Conduct, unethical behaviour, malpractices, illegal acts, or noncompliance with law or regulatory requirements. </p></li>
                                    <li><p>b. The whistleblower processes should only be used to disclose legitimate concerns. This report should be provided in good faith, with no bad intentions other than a reasonable conviction that the facts and any allegations included within are substantially true. No individual shall be entitled to any protection under this Policy if such person has not behaved in good faith. False and malicious accusations made by the reporting person will be taken seriously, characterised as severe misconduct, and, if proven, might result in the whistleblower abusing the system being terminated. </p></li>
                                </ol>

                                        <li><p>c. Anonymous disclosures won't be taken into consideration since they might impede an investigation and the Company's ability to verify the disclosure's veracity. Additionally, the whistleblower will not get any the necessary protection if they stay confidential. The Company does, however, maintain the right to look into an anonymous disclosure.</p></li>

                                    <li><p>a. The person who receives the complaint or disclosure will immediately begin or complete all preliminary investigations. An independent investigative team may be formed to carry out a more thorough inquiry into the topic, depending on the complexity of the situation, the subject, and the seriousness of the alleged misbehaviour. The reporting person will be made aware of who is in charge of the situation, how to get in touch with them, and, if necessary, will be provided additional support from the relevant SEMIX Group departments.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>b. As soon as the investigation is finished, the Board will receive a recommendation for the best course of action for consideration no later than at the subsequent scheduled meeting. In accordance with the Board's decision, the following steps may be taken: i. disciplinary action; ii. closing the case; iii. reporting the issue to the proper parties, such as in situations not involving the Company; and/or iv. special actions the investigator and Board may determine appropriate.</p></li>

                                    <li><p>a. The Company will regard any reports or disclosures as confidential and will only share information with those who have a "need to know" basis or where it is required by a court, government agency, or for investigative purposes. Unless the reporting person chooses to expose his or her name, the identity and other details of the reporting person shall otherwise be kept secret and confidential.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>b. It is the policy of the Company that no employee who makes a good faith report will be subject to any form of retaliatory action, including but not limited to termination, victimisation, demotion, suspension, harassment, or any action causing injury, loss, or other Detrimental Action ("Detrimental Action").</p></li>
                                    <li><p>c. Any Reporting Individual who experienced Detrimental Action as a result of making a valid report in accordance with this Policy may file a complaint using the channels described in the section referred to as "PROCEDURES OF REPORTING," and the same investigative procedures will be followed for any such complaints of Detrimental Action. A worker who takes any particular action against another worker who has reported something in good faith will face disciplinary action.</p></li>
